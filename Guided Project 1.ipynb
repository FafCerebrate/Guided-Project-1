    "We see that Instagram is the top app with over 2 million user reviews.  With 5 apps being over 100 thousand user reviews and a good number being over 10 thousand reviews.  As user reviews are not the same as installs we can consider the review counts to be a fair amount lower than number of installs.\n",

    "With this we have an idea of photography apps being a solid choice in both the google playstore and apple appstore.  We can also see that in both the playstore and appstore, a number of photography apps involve photo editing or photo effects.  Photo effects are something that is limited by creativity, so we can have everyone on the development team and even people from other teams contribute ideas.  If we create an app that provides a good variety of photo effects and even some photo editing then we could be a competing app in both the android and iOs market."

    "In this project, our goal was to provide the development team with a direction on what type of apps to create that will reach as many users in both the google playstore and the apple appstore.  To do this we analyzed data sets that contained a large number of apps from both stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion we have come to is that a Photography app is a good direction to start in.  Photography has the 4th highest number of installs in the google playstore and the 7th highest number of user reviews in the apple appstore.  A good number of them are photography apps that provide photo editing and photo effects.  So to make our app more appealing, we should provide a number of photo effects and some photo editing features.  Photo effects are ideas that everyone in our company can contribue to, not just the development team."
